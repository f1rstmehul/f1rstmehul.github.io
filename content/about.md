I'm a **_software engineer_**, **_amateur astronomer_** & **_cricketer_**.

On the internet, Iâ€™m **_`f1rstmehul`_**. I find coding in [ **_Go_** ](https://go.dev) _really, really fun_ [^1].  
**_Distributed Systems_** and **_Compilers_** interest me the most.  
apart from being close to monitor, I like to explore the cosmos and play cricket.

I'm on, [_twitter_](https://twitter.com/f1rstmehul/), [_github_](https://github.com/f1rstmehul/) and [_linkedin_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/f1rstmehul/).
