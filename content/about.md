I'm a **_software engineer_** & **_amateur astronomer_**. On the internet, I’m **_`f1rstmehul`_**. My actual name(s)? Depends on who’s calling and how serious it sounds. I have three names. Not aliases. Not fake IDs. Just... names.

- my mom’s side calls me **_`mehul`_** (_/ˈmeɪ.hʊl/_) (the internet picked that one too) 
- at home and in my village, I’m **_`manish`_** (_/ˈmanɪʃ/_) .
- and **_`Parmeshwar`_** (_/pəɾ.meɕ.ʋəɾ/_) – the legal one. found on IDs, passport and on serious documents.

So if you’re ever confused, don’t worry — I am too sometimes.

I enjoy writing code, especially in [Go](https://go.dev) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).  
Distributed systems and compilers interest me the most. 
When I'm not close to a monitor, I’m usually looking up at the sky or out on a cricket field.

I'm on, [_x (or twitter)_](https://x.com/f1rstmehul/), [_github_](https://github.com/f1rstmehul/) and [_linkedin_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/f1rstmehul/).
